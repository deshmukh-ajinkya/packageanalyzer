# Package Analyzer

**Package Analyzer** is a web application designed to help developers evaluate the reliability of their project dependencies. It provides insights based on key metrics like stars and forks by fetching real-time data from the GitHub API.

## Key Features

- **Dependency Evaluation**: Analyze a repository's reliability by checking stars, forks, and open issues.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Easily search for repositories and view detailed statistics.
- **Reliability Rating**: Get a score based on stars, forks, and dependency health to assess repository worth.
- **Comparison Tool**: Compare multiple repositories side by side to aid in decision-making.
- **Responsive Design**: Works seamlessly across all devices.

## How It Works

1. **Input Repository Name**: Enter the name of the dependency or import a `package.json` file.
2. **Fetch Data**: The app retrieves real-time data about the repository's metrics.
3. **View Reports**: Get a comprehensive overview of the repository's reliability, including a breakdown of its dependencies.

### Reliability Metrics

- **Stars**: Indicates popularity and community approval.
- **Forks**: Shows engagement from other developers.
- **Dependency Analysis**: Identifies outdated dependencies and known vulnerabilities.

## Usage Instructions
